# Regression-project-bases-on-Zomato-Delivery-Data

Initial Data Overview

In the initial stage, we had a total of 18 columns and 30,000 rows.
We cleaned the data and converted some columns to numeric types. Additionally, we applied StandardScaler to minimize the impact of high values by normalizing the data.
 Finally, we utilized a ColumnTransformer and a pipeline to streamline the modeling process.
